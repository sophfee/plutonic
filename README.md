# Welcome
Plutonic is a closed-source weapon base designed exclusively for use with Landis Games services. Using the outdated and lacking Longsword weapon base as reference, Plutonic was rebuilt, and optimized to the dot for maximum performance with some of the best effects and visuals out there to date.

# How do I use?
Look at the sample files in documentation!
